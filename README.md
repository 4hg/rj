# Rj (WiP)
A slim environment for running [J](https://jsoftware.com) code inspired by an online [K runner](https://ngn.codeberg.page/k/#) and [Inline::J](https://raku.land/zef:elcaro/Inline::J) created because I wanted to play with GUI and FFI creation in Ruby.
## Requirements

- J, see [here](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/System/Installation) for more info
